Evaluated multiple passwords for strength and documented best practices for creating secure passwords.
# Task 6 â€“ Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective
To understand the characteristics of strong passwords by creating and testing them with online tools, and identifying best practices in password security.



## Passwords Tested and Results

| Password              | Score  | Complexity   | Feedback Summary                                       |
|-----------------------|--------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 'password123'         | 43%    | Good         | Common password, lacks symbols, uses sequences         |
| 'thisispassword'      | 13%    | Very Weak    | Only lowercase letters, too predictable                |
| '$HbxZB)r3uwR'        | 100%   | Very Strong  | Good length and variety, minor deductions              |
| 'sEsXJ8RADNbX5+w3'    | 100%   | Very Strong  | Strong length, symbol usage, some character repetition |
| '@MpNg=2?AsEb5oJ'     | 100%   | Very Strong  | Excellent complexity, no deductions                    |



## Learnings from Evaluation

- Strong passwords combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Randomness and length are critical for strength.
- Repetition, common words, and predictable sequences weaken passwords.
- Online checkers provide insights into how easily a password can be cracked.



## Conclusion
Strong passwords are a cornerstone of cybersecurity. Through this task, we learned that length, unpredictability, and character variety significantly enhance password strength. Password managers and MFA add critical protection layers.
